```lrc
[00:16.61] Wake up alone
[00:22.83] In the morning, with no one at my side
[00:33.96] Could it be
[00:38.55] I've waited too long
[00:44.15] Waiting for the lucky one
[00:56.65] 
[00:49.80] My sweetheart, where are you?
[00:54.96] I need someone to spend my time with
[01:01.20] To give and share all my love
[01:15.70] 
[01:11.49] Back in bed
[01:16.46] It's 3 a.m with no one at my side
[01:25.88] It gets real cold
[01:31.57] Because these blankets
[01:34.82] Will never warm my heart
[01:46.82] 
[01:43.22] My sweetheart, where are you?
[01:48.67] I need someone to spend time with
[01:54.96] To give and share my love
[02:07.46] 
[02:04.84] My sweetheart, where are you?
[02:09.96] I need someone spend time with
[02:16.21] To give and share all my love
[02:30.71] 
[02:26.46] My sweetheart, where are you?
[02:31.48] I need someone to spend time with
[02:37.76] To give and share all my love
